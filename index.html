<h1 id="some-math-texts">Some math texts</h1>
<p>In this page, you will find some didatic texts about different
subjects in mathematics. I make then when I am studuying something that
I feel some good font is missing. It is also a good form of learning for
me.</p>
<p>Each text has a very specific goal. The idea is not to be part of a
book or develop a lengnth theory. This does not mean they are logically
minimal. Far from it, many times some redunt results are proven as a
mean to motivativate a more abstract version of it.</p>
<p>History of mathematics is also that is also present. I love to see
how ideas develop, and many strange proofs instigate me to go look for
hints on how this or that came to be.</p>
