# Some math texts

In this page, you will find some didatic texts about different subjects in mathematics. 
I make then when I am studuying something that I feel some good font is missing. 
It is also a good form of learning for me. 

Each text has a very specific goal. The idea is not to be part of a book or develop a lengnth theory. 
This does not mean they are logically minimal. 
Far from it, many times some redunt results are proven as a mean to motivativate a more abstract version of it. 

History of mathematics is also that is also present. I love to see how ideas develop, and many strange proofs instigate me to go look for hints on how this or that came to be.
